<p class="text_article"><span class="subtitle_article"><br>An important part of using software is the license. It allows the user to know what his rights are on a product and what he can do with it.
  So he knows which license he can use for a production and a distribution
  This is why licenses allow to create a settings between users and owners of software, which are thus valued by their work while maintaining the total or partial integrity depending on the type of license
  
  So we will be going  to see what a license is in several parts. 
  
  What is a license, with the EULA notably, the characteristic 

  <br> <br>
  
  In a second part different type of license
  
  The software license is a contract between a right holder and a user that allows them to deliver rights in terms of use, distribution, modification etc...
  
  That's how we can link this to the article about proprietary and free licenses
  Indeed, proprietary licenses are made of obligations
  
  Thus the large publishers charge the license, not for the cost of reproduction, which is minimal, but for the cost of research, i.e. in man-years (a unit of measurement corresponding to one year's work), which corresponds to the investment made in terms of time to develop such a program.
  
  And so when you buy the software, you buy the product, but this is accompanied by the acceptance of the EULA composed of the terms of use of the application
  
  So when a software is proprietary, the conditions of use are quite restricted and limited, while the free software even if it can be paid is more permissive on its possibilities

  fixed license / nominative license : It is a license issued for a single device via the mac address in particular  <br> <br>
  variable license : It is a license that can be shared on a number of computers
  <br><br>
  Shareware : It is a license whose right is delivered temporarily as a subscription, example the office suite of Microsoft 
  <br><br>
  free license : It is a license characterized more permissive on four points in particular:
  <br><br>
  - usage<br>
  - access to the source code to understand or adapte its needs<br>
  - Code modification is possible in order to improve it<br>
  - The software even modified can be redistributed even commercially<br>
  
  <br><br>
  In conclusion, the notion of license is vast and complex but we can bring this closer to the article on proprietary and free licenses.
